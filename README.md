# xToolMerge

A command line utility that takes two XTool XCS files and output them as a merged single file leaving the original un-changed.

This is very beta, please backup your files first.

## Usage
You'll need two files generated by xTool Creative Space.

For example here are two files that you may want combined into one:

2. Navigate to your `xToolMerge` directory
3. Enter a command like the following example:

`xtoolmerge --sourceFile1 C:\Users\kevin\Desktop\Output.xcs --sourceFile2 C:\Users\kevin\Desktop\Luke-Saber-NewHope.xcs --outputFilename c:\Users\kevin\Desktop\output.xcs`
